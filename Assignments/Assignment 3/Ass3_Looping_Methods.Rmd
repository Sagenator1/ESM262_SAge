# Our highway

3 car types 

Imagine with have 4 different car types - and we know how often each occurs:

* car A mass 20000 kg, area 22 m^2

* car B mass 65000 kg, area 30 m^2

* car C mass 38000 kg, area 22 m^2

* car D mass 5,000 kg, area 10 m^2 

Mean highway speed is 80 km/hr w/ sd = 10 km/hr m^2

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}

# source autopower function
source("../R/autopower.R")

# generate a structure to store info on our possible cars
possible_cars = data.frame(name = c("A","B","C","D"),mass=c(10000,65000,38000,5000), area = c(22,30,22,10))

# convert from km/h to m/s, multiply by 0.278
speed_base = 80 * 0.278
speed_sd = 10 * 0.278

# estimate power for each car type for speed_base
# and add power to the data structure
possible_cars$power = autopower(V=speed_base, A = possible_cars$area, m=possible_cars$mass)

head(possible_cars)

```

Part a) For Loop

```{r withforloop}


# possible_cars holds estimate average power use given each car

possible_cars

# we want to generate nsample of speeds (200 here) 
nsample = 200

# assume a normal distribution of speeds with mean 80km/hr and sd 10km/hr
# for nsample number of speeds
speeds = rnorm(mean=speed_base, sd=speed_sd, n=nsample)
summary(speeds)

# what does the speed distribution look like
plot(density(speeds), ylab="Distribution of Speeds in (m/s)")


# create a data frame to store results - similar to possible_cars
# one column for each car and one row for each speed
powerall_a = as.data.frame(matrix(nrow=length(speeds), ncol=nrow(possible_cars)))

# because we don't initialize it - values are NA
head(powerall_a)

# check how many cars columns are there
nrow(possible_cars)

# index into a matrix (like powerall_a) is by row and column powerall_a[2,5] is 2nd row and 5th column
for (i in 1:nrow(possible_cars)) {
  powerall_a[,i] = autopower(A=possible_cars$area[i], m=possible_cars$mass[i], V=speeds)
}

# now matrix is filled in with power data
head(powerall_a)

# add column names
colnames(powerall_a)=possible_cars$name

# for plotting sometimes its useful to turn columns in to rows
powerallr_a = powerall_a %>% pivot_longer(cols=everything(), names_to="car", values_to="power")

# check
head(powerallr_a)

# quick visualization
method1_plot = ggplot(powerallr_a, aes(car,power, fill=car))+geom_boxplot()+ggtitle("for loop results") + labs(x = "Car", y = "Power (W)") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
method1_plot

# Summary of for loop analysis
summary(powerallr_a)


```
Part 2) - Use pmap

```{r withpmap}

# possible_cars holds estimate average power use given each car

possible_cars

# we want to generate nsample of speeds (200 here) 
nsample = 200

# assume a normal distribution of speeds with mean 80km/hr and sd 10km/hr
# for nsample number of speeds
speeds = rnorm(mean=speed_base, sd=speed_sd, n=nsample)
summary(speeds)

# what does the speed distribution look like
plot(density(speeds), ylab="Distribution of Speeds in (m/s)")

# pmap runs a function for each value in a list of parameters, with other parameters set for each iteration
powerall_b = pmap(list(A = possible_cars$area, m=possible_cars$mass), autopower, V=speeds)

# turn pmap results into a data frame for easier graphing
# add column names
powerall_b = as.data.frame(powerall_b, col.names=possible_cars$name)

# check
head(powerall_b)


# for plotting sometimes its useful to turn columns in to rows
powerallr_b = powerall_b %>% pivot_longer(cols=everything(), names_to="car", values_to="power")

# check
head(powerallr_b)

# quick visualization
method2_plot = ggplot(powerallr_b, aes(car,power, fill=car))+geom_boxplot()+ggtitle("pmap results") + labs(x = "Car", y = "Power (W)") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
method2_plot

# put plots side by side
# to confirm that they look similar
ggarrange(method1_plot, method2_plot)

# compare values
head(powerallr_a)
head(powerallr_b)

# Looks exactly the same with the same speed profile

# but we can compare means - values close, within reason
powerall_a %>% map(mean)
powerall_b %>% map(mean)

# upper 90% quantile - values close, within reason
powerall_a %>% map(quantile, probs=0.9)
powerall_b %>% map(quantile, probs=0.9)

# they are close but still not exact
# statistics such as means and quantiles are similar
# relative difference between cars is the same
summary(powerallr_a)
summary(powerallr_b)
```
